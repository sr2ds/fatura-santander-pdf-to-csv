# PDF to CSV - Santander

** this is just a personal script to simplify my life, not to production works **

A simple JS script to retrieve data from Banco Santander PDF and return transactions as CSV.

It's not perfect but it works and I'll improve in slow mode.

I did this just to simplify my financial organization, every month I need to grab every PDF line to put in my personal financial XLS manually, and this script can make my life easier.
